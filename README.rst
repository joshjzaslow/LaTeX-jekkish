Jekkish
=======

Inspired by the writing workflow of Markdown + YAML used in Jekyll, I
wanted a system that would allow me to do something similar for LaTeX
files. More often than not, I reuse my LaTeX styles, and import a file
of content in the {maincontent} environment. Hopefully you can find it
useful too.

This system takes a content that is marked-up with LaTeX, and has a YAML
header, generates a full LaTeX file, and then compiles this with pdftex.

While this code works (with no guarantees), it definitely needs tests
and better error handling and more flexible of code. That said, this is
far enough along that it works... so that's pretty awesome! These files
can be built directly in Sublime Text if you follow the instructions
below.

I intend to keep this compatible with both Python 2 and 3, but since it
is in alpha, Python 3 support is not always guaranteed.

Tested (thus far) on OSX.

Installation
------------

This package is available on PyPI. To install, just type '''pip install
jekkish''' in your terminal.

If you use SublimeText, you can use place jekkish.sublime-build in your
SublimeÂ Packages/User.}

Dependencies.
-------------

This package uses PyYAML, Jinja2. It assumes that pdftex is installed
and included in the system path.

I haven't included any templates in this package. These should be placed
in ~/.jekkish/

    Look at \emph{all} of the things I wrote!

The only *reserved* variable names are and . Feel free to use any others
you find useful for your documents. The system uses Jinja2, so you are
free to make templates as simple or complicated as you please.

-   assumes that .tex can be found in ~/.jekkish
-   should be placed in the mainmatter of your template as follows
   \`\`\`(((content))).
-  Everything above the YAML header will be ignored.
-  Everything below the YAML header will be rendered in the
   (((content))) tag.

In the template, the These files are essentially LaTeX files, but with
some templating logic.

-   ((\* *)) is used for template logic
-   (((variable\_name))) is used for where variables will be rendered.
-   ((= comments =)) are found between these characters
