# YammTeX (Working title)

* article._tex -- goes in ~/.yammTex
* yammtex.py -- symbolic linked to a location in path
* YammTex.sublime-build -- goes in Sublime\ Packages/User

Inspired by the writing system of Markdown + YAML used in Jekyll, I wanted a system that would allow me to do something similar for TeX files. More often than not, I reuse my LaTeX styles, and import a file of content. This is fairly limited to the possibilities for templating I can do with a more Jekyll-like system, so off I go!

Current version is written in python. It needs tests and error handling and flexible code. But its far enough along that it actually works... so that's pretty awesome! I can also currently build these files from Sublime.
